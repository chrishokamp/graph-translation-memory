Movement creates noise .

China reacted furiously .
That is my protest .
Hence the distinction drawn .
That is the issue here .
That is what this is about .
That would be ideal .
That is democracy .
There is a consensus on that .
That is transparency .
That is nonsense .
That is all .
That is a pity .
This is extremely worrying .
That is clear .
No , it did not !
No , it did not .
That has been done .
This is excellent .
This is unacceptable .
That is clear .
That is quite clear .
It is pathetic !
That is a fact of life .
That is correct .
That is quite right .
That is positive .
It is a sensational result .
And that is essential .
This is unethical .
There is nothing controversial about that .
It is disgraceful .
That is essential .
That is important .
And maybe it will .
That sounds dangerous .
This is not true !
That is wrong .
That simply is not true .
It is indeed .
That was unfortunate .
I understand this .
This will be done .
We know it is .
I have nothing else to say .
That would be devastating .
That would be terrible .
The sentence exists .
Tempus fugit !
The matter is urgent .
This is to be regretted .
This is completely wrong .
This is not acceptable .
It is perverse .
That was refused .
The risk is there .
This is working .
But stronger than whom?
But where to now?
Your point is well made .
A final comment .

How would you describe this?
Now , how can this possibly be?
How do they happen?

What would your answer be to that?
How can we become more competitive?

How have they been established?
We are working on that .
We congratulate you .
This is welcome .

But we know that .
But seriously .
And not just that .
But why are we not helping out?
But what do these sanctions mean?
And what exactly should be done?
But who are the clients?
But how , and in what cases?
Paragraph G is inaccurate .
Finally , human rights .
All these things must be stopped .
This is completely absurd .
All the cases are awaiting a decision .
All cigarettes are harmful .
We should however urge caution .
Everything else is wishful thinking .
Nothing else matters .

Everything has become more and more complex .
Or , in a nutshell , manipulation .
Questions to Mrs de Palacio
Answers are still awaited .
Poverty is an injustice .
This is what Rule 7 states:
No one doubts that either .
That too is feasible .
This was also untrue .
That was also refused .
This is also included .
Export refunds are not a subsidy .
Very well , Mr Seguro .

This is understandable .
I wish to express our thanks .

Thank you for your understanding .
Nothing would change .
We are working on that .
Unfortunately that is not the case .
I think we need to retain it .
I am entitled to that .
We have to draw on that .
We are all waiting for this moment .
I wanted to point this out .
That is the question .
This is what we are doing .
That was the point here !
That I do know about .
This is hardly ever discussed .
The delta of the Danube is in danger .
The result is sobering .
Kosovo is a ravaged country .
Parliament supports this .
The system is highly effective .
The virus harms cold - blooded animals .
The water levels continue to rise .
That alone is not enough .
This , I deeply regret .
This is something which I very much regret .
This should not happen .
That is quite fundamental .
That would seem odd to me .
This seems to us perverse .
I found that remarkable in itself .
But that cannot happen .
This is not tolerable .
But this happens on a regular basis .
I do not think so .
I realise that .
There are three reasons for this .
They have failed to do that .
That has changed .
We look forward to that .
That is your right .
That is point one .
That is the first point .
That is absolutely unacceptable .
This is completely new .
That is all quite true .
That is the crucial thing .
That is the first thing .
It is the same problem .
This is the challenge .
That is the reality .
That is the reality of the situation .
That is the name of the game .
That is absolutely absurd .
Surely this is too absurd for words !
There is an urgent need for this .
This is praiseworthy in itself .
That is quite in order .
This is just scandalous .
This is scandalous .
By any standards , this is preposterous .
It is simply unfair .
No problem at all .
They are very sad happenings indeed .
And rightly so .
This is a good move .
It was not by chance at all !
That to me is modest .
We all know that !
That is my plea .
That is unacceptable .
That is unreasonable .
She did not succeed .
This is unacceptable !
This is unacceptable .
This is not acceptable .
That is not the case .
That is shocking .
This is not easily done .
It is quite out of the question .
That cannot be done .
This does not make sense .
That is not unusual .
This is important .
That is not true .
This is not the case .
This is not the usual state of affairs .
That has now been cleared up .
That is a good balance .
This is purely accidental .
This is very serious .
That makes absolute sense .
That is extremely important .
That is very important .
This is extremely important .
It is vital to do that .
That is extremely important .
This is an extremely serious matter .
We noticed that .
This is something we know about .
This is the topic .
That is our main task .
That is our challenge .
That is our duty .
That is our position .
It is a waste of time .
That is a lot of money .
That much is absolutely clear .
That is important to note .
That goes without saying .
This is completely unacceptable !
This could not be further from the truth .
That is excellent news !
There is research data on that .
That is a good thing .
That is what we should condemn .
That is deeply disturbing .
That is very regrettable .
This is deeply unfair .
It is extremely important .
This is extremely important .
This is normal procedure .
This is not acceptable .
That would not make any sense .
Mr President , that has to change .
This must be noted .
This is something to be taken into consideration .
This needs to be said !
This must be borne in mind .
This must change !
It needs to be re - done .
This situation must change .
We must understand this .
We must recognise that .
We must go further in this regard .
This is called money laundering .
That is the background .
These are the questions .
These are therefore important matters .
That should be supported .
You should do that !
We should not change that .
This is not in question .
I am sorry about that .
It is causing serious harm .
That was the first point .
That was the problem .
That was the decision .
This was no mean feat !
They did not do so .
That contradicts the basic intention .
That is not guaranteed .
We women are already familiar with this procedure .
That is what we all want .
Nothing has changed there .
That has already been said .
That is the effect it would have .
That would be a disaster .
That would have been desirable .
I would be delighted if we could .
This smacks of contradiction .
There is no need for it .
This is why this resolution is necessary .
One of these groups is the disabled .
Court judgments have been passed on this .
That did not happen .
De Palacio , Commission .
This is not the case !
I agree with that .
The request is withdrawn .
The euro is to be introduced .
Peace is necessary .
The reason for that is simple .
The fight goes on .
The postal services are important .
Such a concern is misplaced .
That is why we need transparency .
For this reason , we are against it .
That concludes the debate .
That concludes the vote .
Voting time is suspended .
The cost of alcohol fell .
The alternative is clear .
The answer is simple .
The answer is no - one .
That is a mammoth task .
The committee work can start .
That concludes the debate .
That concludes the joint debate .
The debate is closed .
The joint debate is closed .
The vote will be taken later this evening .
Conditions are ripe .
These are terrifying figures .
The EU makes a difference .
The resolution is clear .
The results are acceptable .
The facts are clear .
Air fares would go up .
We know what actually happened .
But the question remains .
That woman was sobbing her heart out .
It is out of time .
Everyone has different tastes .
This is the Rule in this House .
The challenge was immense .
Ports must be equipped with reception facilities .
The Commission thinks it should .
Short sea shipping requires destinations .
It is a voluntary scheme .
The after - shocks can still be felt .
It is the projection of stability .
The President is right .
Reality is obstinate .
The directive remains in place .
We are all aware of the situation .
The death penalty was mentioned .
Transport policy requires choices .
It is important that business has legal certainty .
The newspaper reports were misleading .
The other parties are not paying .
This is greatly disappointing .
This is also important .
And this is a weak point .
That is unacceptable .
This is not acceptable .
That is not correct .
This has now been done .
This is highly technical .
It is extremely important .
This is where we want to go .
This is totally unacceptable .
The first country is Indonesia .
It can be dangerous to health .
That is in nobody ' s interest .
This conflicts with human rights .
I endorse this view .
That debate has been concluded .
This terminology should be withdrawn .
That is a demagogic provision .
We are all familiar with these requirements .
This freedom remains .
That seizure was an illegal act .
This situation is unsustainable .
This situation is getting worse .
This percentage is a familiar figure .
That time is up .
This was one of them .
This change is a complicated change .
This was an unfair comment .
This principle is called damage limitation .
But he is not threatening anybody .
Unfortunately , however , they do exist .
The victims are waiting outside .
Commissioner: three questions:
Thirdly , technical assistance .
This is therefore a matter of urgency .

Success encourages further ambition .
Please do not get excited .
Firstly , there is the regional approach .
It is still our aim .
A state of emergency followed .
It has a bearing on employment .
I refer to Eurodac .
It is about intervention .
There are differences .
There are certainly boundaries .
There is an image problem .
People have overstepped the mark .
There is a vicious circle .
No , we do not .
There is no other such policy .
There is no miracle cure .
No statistical data exists .
There is effective legal precaution .
This is just too much micromanagement .
There are two questions .
There are two approaches .
There are two possibilities .
There is undoubtedly progress .
It has been a long time coming .
They do have freedom of speech .
Some movement is discernible .
It is quite normal .
It is a catastrophe .
It is shameful !
It is their future .
It is badly drafted .
It can give us no confidence whatsoever .
It is so embarrassing .
They must translate into action .
It was a slip of the tongue .
Action is taken .
The changeover will require an effort .
Europe for us is responsibility for the environment .
